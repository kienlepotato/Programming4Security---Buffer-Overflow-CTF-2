//Step. 1 UPDATE

If you have a problem with these instructions and apt failing because of keys. 

sudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali-archive-keyring.asc

If you have a missing public key replace F6BC with the key you need:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys F6BC

//Step 2. Install GCC libraries 
sudo apt install gcc-multilib

//Step 3. Disable ASLR
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0


//Step 3. Make the vulnnerable application

//Step3.1 Enter this command in command prompt to create a C script:
nano bad.c

//Step 3.2 Copy+Paste the following code into the window:
---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main (int argc, char** argv){
 //Make a buffer make this bigger than the minimum you will need
 //You will want to make this large enough to fit shell code and lots of nops
 char buffer[500];
 //copy cmdline input into the buffer.
 strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
 //return 0 because that is what we do if stuff exits normally.
 return 0;
}
